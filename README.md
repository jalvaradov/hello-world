As a wise man once said, today is a new day in which someone will type a story about wise men and new days.
Today is not that day, the wise man was never real, nor wise; wich is irrelevant since he didn't exist in the first place.
In fact, he was not even fictitious, because the story was never written.
Furthermore, that day is certainly NOT today.
All that is left to say, in addition to anything else that can be said, is that this was a waste of time and energy.
Therefore, I am not a wise man.
Although today is a new day indeed.
